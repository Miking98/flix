# Project 2 - *Flix*

**Flix** is a movies app using the [The Movie Database API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#).

Time spent: **15** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

- [ X ] User can view a list of movies currently playing in theaters from The Movie Database.
- [ X ] Poster images are loaded using the UIImageView category in the AFNetworking library.
- [ X ] User sees a loading state while waiting for the movies API.
- [ X ] User can pull to refresh the movie list.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ X ] User sees an error message when there's a networking error.
- [ X ] Movies are displayed using a CollectionView instead of a TableView.
- [ X ] User can search for a movie.
- [ X ] All images fade in as they are loading.
- [ X ] User can view the large movie poster by tapping on a cell.
- [ ] For the large poster, load the low resolution image first and then switch to the high resolution image when complete.
- [ ] Customize the selection effect of the cell.
- [ ] Customize the navigation bar.
- [ X ] Customize the UI.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ X ] Added a Trailer View so that a Youtube video modal loads when the user clicks the movie poster thumbnail in the Detail View
- [ X ] Placeholder image displayed while images load on home screen
- [ X ] Scrolling description in Detail View for when a movie's overview overflows its UITextBox container

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. What customizations for the UI people thought of
2. Abstracting away large chunks of code that didn't really change between view controllers (e.g. the repetitive network requests)

## Notes

Spent a lot of time trying to get the official Youtube iOS Cocoapod (youtube-ios-player-helper) to work, managed to get xCOde to recognize the YTPlayer class by adding a Bridging file, but couldn't get the video to load in the actual UIView element.
